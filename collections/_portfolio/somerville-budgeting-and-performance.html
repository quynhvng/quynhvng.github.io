<p>This is one of the cases designed by professors at "Accounting is Analytics" to integrate analytics into their accounting classes.
  You can <a href="https://accountingisanalytics.com/2019/12/31/somerville-ma/">view full details of the case here</a>.
</p>
<h2>Case summary</h2>
<p>The city of Somerville, MA, USA, posts its checkbook online. This case uses <a href="https://data.somervillema.gov/">Somerville's open
  checkbook data</a> from 2013–2016, which has over 55,000 records. The case requires you to analyse trend and composition of the city's
  spending and variances in its budget using pivot table. All data, except the budget and "Item Class" column, is real world data.

<p>Overall, there seems to be an upward trend in total spending, though there was a decrease every other year. General government expense made
  up the majority of spending and was increasing in both absolute and relative terms. Meanwhile, public work expense saw the greatest reduction
  in more recent years and education expenses increased modestly but shrank in relative to total spending.
</p>
<p>Examining general expense further, we see that there was an upward trend in professional services, technology, and bonds and debt-related
  expenditures. Same as education expense, education-related expense in the general government category was also reducing.
</p>
<p>In regard to budget variances, large variances in absolute term (determined with a cut-off, e.g. over $1,000,000) should be investigated.
  Similarly, a cut-off should be devised for variance in relative term. In general, variances significant in both relative and absolute terms
  and budget deficits should be prioritised in investigation. However, an investigation into budget surplus may improve cost-saving measures.
