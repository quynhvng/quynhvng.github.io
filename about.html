<h1>About me and this site</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! My name is Quá»³nh. This site is where I post my works and other stuff of interest.
</p>
<p>
  My only works at the moment are visualisations of financial data. However, I planned to make a blog 
  about accounting, plus other science or art topics, and it should be coming soon (maybe). Currently, 
  I'm working on myself, unwinding from burn-out, and learning programming and German.
</p>
<p>
  I graduated from Foreign Trade University (Vietnam) with a bachelor's in accounting and auditing. I 
  also studied for ACCA Qualification and earned their Advanced Diploma in Accounting and Business. I 
  am interested in humanitarian causes, technologies, and arts and highly value integrity and innovation.
